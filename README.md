Setup

1. The dealer shuffles and deals each player 7 cards.
2. Place the remainder of the deck facedown to form a DRAW pile.
3. The top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to begin a DISCARD pile.

NOTE: If an Action Card or Wild Card is turned over, the player to the left of the dealer must perform the action (Action Card) or choose a color (Wild Card).

Let's Play

1. The person to the left of the dealer starts play.
2. On your turn, you must match a card from your hand to the card on the top of the DISCARD pile, either by number, color or Action Card symbol.
3. If you don't have a card that matches, you must take a card from the DRAW pile. If the card you picked up can be played, you are free to put it down in the same turn. Otherwise, play moves on to the next person.
4. If no player is out of cards by the time the DRAW pile is depleted, the DISCARD pile is reshuffled and play continues.

Going Out

1. When you play your next-to-last card, you must yell "UNO" (meaning "one") to indicate that you have only one card left. If you don't yell "UNO" and you are caught before the next player begins their turn, you must draw two cards.
2. Once a player has no cards left, the round is over. Points are scored (see SCORING below) and play starts over again.
3. If the last card played in a round is a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card, the next player must draw the 2 or 4 cards respectively. These cards are counted when the points are totaled.

Action Cards

1. Draw Two card - When you play this card, the next player must draw 2 cards and skip their turn.
2. Reverse card - When you play this card, the direction of play reverses (if play is currently to the left, then it changes to the right, and vice versa).
3. Skip card - When you play this card, the next player must skip their turn.

NOTE: Action cards may ONLY be played on cards with matching color or action symbol.

Wild Cards

1. Wild card - When you play this card, you get to choose the color that continues play. You may play a Wild card on your turn even if you have another playable card in your hand.
2. Wild Draw 4 card - When you play this card, you get to choose the color that continues play PLUS the next player must draw 4 cards from the DRAW pile and skip their turn. However, you may only play this card when you do NOT have another card in your hand that matches the COLOR on the DISCARD pile.

NOTE: If you suspect that a Wild Draw 4 card has been played on you illegally (i.e. the player has a matching color card), then you may challenge that player. The challenged player must show you (the challenger) their hand. If guilty, the challenged player must draw the 4 cards instead of you. However, if the challenged player is innocent, you must draw the 4 cards PLUS an additional 2 cards (6 total)!

3. Wild Shuffle Hands card - When you play this card, collect EVERY card from EACH player's hand, shuffle all the cards together and then deal them back to each player, starting with the player to your left. Deal the cards until there are no cards left. Some players may end up with more or less cards than they had before. Play then continues in the current direction of play. This card is also a wild card, so you get to choose the color that resumes play.
4. Wild Customizable card - Use a #2 pencil to write any house rule you wish on a card. The only limit is your imagination (and the consent of the other players). This is a wild card so you may play it on your turn even if you have another playable card in your hand. Also, you choose the color that resumes play.

NOTE: The cards are erasable, so you may write a new rule each time you play!

Vision Statement

FOR the first player WHO will get rid of all THE UNO cards in each round THAT score points for the cards opponents are left holding. UNLIKE other card games without any points, OUR game has points in rounds which accumulate and the first player to reach 500 points wins.

Scoring

The first player to get rid of their cards in a round receives points for all of the cards left in their opponents hands as follows:

1. All number cards (0-9) .............................. Face Value
2. Draw Two ............................................ 20 Points
3. Reverse ............................................. 20 Points
4. Skip ................................................ 20 Points
5. Wild ................................................ 50 Points
6. Wild Draw Four ...................................... 50 Points
7. Wild Shuffle Hands .................................. 40 Points
8. Customizable ........................................ 40 Points

Once the score for the round has been tallied, if no player has reached 500 points, reshuffle the cards and begin a new round.
